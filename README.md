LookTouch will use eye tracking combined with gesture controls to create a never-before-seen user interface as applied in a simple game environment.

The game will feature aiming using the eye tracking and gesture controls to manipulate objects. An initial game idea is a survival game where zombies are coming towards you - so you aim at them with your eyes and use the force with an upward swipe to catapult them into the air and then bat them away with a quick horizontal gesture.

The project will involve combining the two SDKs to work together in C++, which as we know, has never been done before.

Tools Used: EyeTribe eye tracker (https://theeyetribe.com/), Thalmic Myo armband (https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/)
